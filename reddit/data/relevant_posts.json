Example, if I\u2019m home and someone needs a spare car key cut, I let them come to me if it\u2019s convenient. Since these changes, I\u2019ve stopped appearing in the local map pack for my service area..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect a competitor may have made these edits.

In the past, you could hear about a suspension cases between 48 hours to two weeks.  Now, waiting over 4 weeks isnt uncommon.  My theory is it had to do with the recent bug that caused the review count to misalign and now Google is flooded with cases.\n\nFor now, if you have a case open about a suspension and you have been waiting for over 2 weeks, contact the [Google Business Profile forums](https://support.google.com/business/community?hl=en) and they may be able to assist.",

In the past, you could hear about a suspension cases between 48 hours to two weeks.  Now, waiting over 4 weeks isnt uncommon.  My theory is it had to do with the recent bug that caused the review count to misalign and now Google is flooded with cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For now, if you have a case open about a suspension and you have been waiting for over 2 weeks, contact the &lt;a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/community?hl=en\"&gt;Google Business Profile forums&lt;/a&gt; and they may be able to assist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

So, we wanted to share some practical tweaks that can actually boost calls, clicks, and local rankings\u2014without waiting months for results.\n\nFirst, ditch keyword stuffing in your business name and focus on search intent instead. While having keywords in your name can help, Google has been cracking down on spammy edits. A better approach is to optimize your business description and services with naturally phrased keywords that match real customer searches. Instead of \u201cBest Pizza in NYC | Joe\u2019s Famous Pizza,\u201d try something more natural like \u201cAuthentic New York-style pizza with handmade dough &amp; fresh toppings.\u201d\n\nAnother overlooked but powerful strategy is to post fresh photos weekly. Google rewards engagement, and frequently updating your profile with real, high-quality images can improve visibility. Instead of stock photos, upload before-and-after shots, pictures of happy customers (with permission!), or new products and seasonal promotions. For an extra local SEO edge, geotag your images before uploading them.\n\nResponding to reviews quickly (especially negative ones) also plays a big role in rankings. As we mentioned, Google favors active profiles, so try to reply within 24-48 hours to all reviews. When it comes to negative feedback, acknowledge the issue, show empathy, and offer a simple resolution. Even a simple response like, \u201cHey \\[Name\\], we\u2019re sorry about your experience! We\u2019d love to make it right. Give us a call at \\[number\\] so we can fix this for you,\u201d can go a long way in improving your reputation and customer trust.\n\nMost businesses ignore the Q&amp;A section on their GBP, but it\u2019s an SEO goldmine. Did you know you can pre-fill common questions and answers yourself? This ensures potential customers get the right information upfront, rather than relying on random user-submitted questions.\n\nAnother simple but effective tweak is optimizing your service areas wisely. Listing every city within a 50-mile radius can look suspect. Instead, focus on your primary service locations and a few nearby towns where you actively do business.\n\nFinally, if you really want to stand out, try using Google Business Profile Posts for promotions, updates, and events. While they don\u2019t directly impact rankings, they do increase engagement, and did we mention how much Google loves that already?\n\nWhat\u2019s worked best for your GBP so far?
