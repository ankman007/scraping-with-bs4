Possibly with some kind of repeatable template.**\n\nThanks so much!!\n\n",

Right now I&amp;#39;m just focusing Google Reviews, and Profile optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First I want to work with my friend&amp;#39;s businesses to get some feedback, validation and to refine my processes - and a big part of that will be to actually measure if what I do is working or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to provide clients with a pdf report with measurements, graphs, scores and to visually interpret data of (hopefully) their profiles progress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question is; What would you recommend to include and whats the best way to display it and possibly automate it? Possibly with some kind of repeatable template.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Most of them work remotely\u2014meeting clients at their homes, restaurants, golf courses, etc., rather than a dedicated office.\n\nAfter a lot of back and forth with Google, I successfully got bulk verification for those willing to display their addresses (usually dedicated offices) by submitting SEC documents linking them to the main firm and a local branch.\n\n**The challenge:**\n\nMany advisors don\u2019t want to display their home addresses, so I need to use service area listings\u2014which aren\u2019t eligible for bulk verification.\n\nI know one option is to verify with an address, then hide it and add a service area. But since these are their home addresses, I don\u2019t want to risk Google unexpectedly displaying them later.\n\nFor video verification, I don\u2019t want to overburden advisors with a long process. Do they really need to start at a street corner showing street signs, then walk into their home office? Or would showing mail with their address be enough?\n\nAny suggestions or experiences with service area verification would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

Most of them work remotely\u2014meeting clients at their homes, restaurants, golf courses, etc., rather than a dedicated office.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a lot of back and forth with Google, I successfully got bulk verification for those willing to display their addresses (usually dedicated offices) by submitting SEC documents linking them to the main firm and a local branch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The challenge:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many advisors don\u2019t want to display their home addresses, so I need to use service area listings\u2014which aren\u2019t eligible for bulk verification.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know one option is to verify with an address, then hide it and add a service area. But since these are their home addresses, I don\u2019t want to risk Google unexpectedly displaying them later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For video verification, I don\u2019t want to overburden advisors with a long process. Do they really need to start at a street corner showing street signs, then walk into their home office? Or would showing mail with their address be enough?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions or experiences with service area verification would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Got them bulk verified by sharing SEC documentation that shows the main company they work (and their address), as well as the branch (with city/state name, no address). The address they are using is in that branch city.\n\nFor the advisors that don't want their address public, could I submit with the main firms address, and once verified hide the address and add the service areas even if those areas are in whole different parts of the country, but are in the cities where the branch in their SEC document is. Or would Google end up suspending because the service area is too far from the original address?\n\nSee image for this to make more sense\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75efu86yzvpe1.png?width=2144&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7a428699eb6d9101794fdba719575e69d87b552\n\nThanks",

The address they are using is in that branch city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the advisors that don&amp;#39;t want their address public, could I submit with the main firms address, and once verified hide the address and add the service areas even if those areas are in whole different parts of the country, but are in the cities where the branch in their SEC document is.
