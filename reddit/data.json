        "post_description": "Creating this thread to address the ongoing issue of Google Support taking many weeks to deal with listing profile suspensions/appeals. Usually it is 3-5 days.  \n**Current time frame is estimated to be about 4-6 weeks once you start the appeal process as of today.**\n\nThese are the steps to take if your listing has been suspended. If you have been waiting a long time, but have followed this path properly, then be reassured that you are in the queue and you just have to be patient.\n\n1. Fill out the first appeal using this process flow: [https://support.google.com/business/workflow/13569690](https://support.google.com/business/workflow/13569690) \\-&gt; Submitting all the proper documentation will keep you from having to go through all the next steps and get your listing back live faster.\n   1. if it shows submitted, then wait till the status changes (you will receive an email when it does)\n   2. if appeal was denied, then go to step 2\n2. Use this form to submit a second appeal: [https://support.google.com/business/contact/local\\_appeals](https://support.google.com/business/contact/local_appeals)\n   1. make sure you submit all the proof they require\n   2. you will receive an email with a ticket number\n   3. wait until support engages with you by email. you are in the queue and they always respond, it may take a few days or longer\n3. If denied again, your last chance is to create a thread at the Google support forum: [https://support.google.com/business/thread/new](https://support.google.com/business/thread/new)\n   1. A Product Expert (volunteer that Google has given specials powers to) can vet your info and escalate with the ticket number you received in step 2. This will not skip the original queue and is like starting over timewise",

Validated that a large majority of listings triggered for re-verification by this bug were re-verified. \n\nThe question: Does this statement also apply to listings that have been suspended or just to new companies that have requested verification?",

The frustrating part is that, while I operate as a mobile locksmith 99% of the time, I do also offer onsite services by appointment. Example, if I\u2019m home and someone needs a spare car key cut, I let them come to me if it\u2019s convenient. Since these changes, I\u2019ve stopped appearing in the local map pack for my service area..\n\nI suspect a competitor may have made these edits. I\u2019m hesitant to switch my profile back to \"onsite service available\" in case it leads to a suspension. ",

I and many others have tried everything to get it fixed but keep getting denied. Just as frustrating is the fact that no specific violations are given, just a deceptive label drop and no clue as to what it is. No response from tickets filed but sorry but your suspended. Our service businesses have been suffering badly do to no exposure and companies like Google My Business that have such a monopoly on the search engines should have LIVE people to help you with such issues. Maybe a lawsuit against GMB will push them to provide LIVE people to navigate issues and get issues resolved. Most other search engines use Googles information on your business to verify your business for there system so if Google has an issue with you then sorry your out of luck... This needs to stop..We will be contacting layers.",
